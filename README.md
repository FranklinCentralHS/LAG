## Reflections

This project had too close of a deadline for following a tutorial and adding custom features.

Gavin - The double jump definitely works but it has a hard time cooperating with the wall jumping feature.
Gavin - I like how effiecient the code is for the double jump but the wall jumping feature is a little buggy with the double jump as it gets confused on which feature to use.
